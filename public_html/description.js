It is grown best when allowed to climb, a mature plant has a neat layered or \"stacked\" appearance. It does also look amazing when grown hanging but the leaves will generally have larger gaps between them preventing that stacked look. Standleyana is an easy growing plant with oval leaves that are a deep green colour and have a mix of speckles, splashes and broad bands of pure white on them."
